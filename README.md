# Newclear
The climate problem is first and foremost an energy problem. To produce sufficient clean renewable energy on a global scale given the current energy growth we will need Nuclear energy. Unfortunately, due to it's history it has an image problem. I propose to rebrand nuclear energy as newclear energy, allmost the same concept with some added connotation.

Newclear (Prononciation [ˈnjuː.klɪə], "new-cleAr" like nuclear) is a contamination of three things:

- New Nuclear Energy (both new as in technology and as in commercial plants)
- (re)Newables (both as in new nuclear energy is a renewable and the classic renewables)
- A "New Clear" image for Nuclear energy. (both as a clear future vision and clear of common misconsceptions)

## Why GitHub?

It's a social media platform with little or no comparison. It enables collaboration and that's exactly what we need to combat climate change. It's also pretty usable even for non-coders (I hope) and is not part of the attention economy/advertising economic model. Given it host's millions of lines of crucially important software it's stability is also a benifit.
